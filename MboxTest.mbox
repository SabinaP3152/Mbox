We&#39;ll meet when I&#39;m there but it looks like something can be worked out, kind of on and off, this summer. If I can combine 108th Street with Lance and Irma&#39;s, and maybe weekends in Woodstock (Irma would love that!) I could be housed for June, July and August, and maybe more.

Dear David, Please give Sabina Pringle departmental approvals for the 3 courses below. Sabina was accepted into L&amp;L one year ago and deferred to Fall 2017. If she can enroll now, I will approve that. I&#39;ve contacted Pauline Pabon to find out if that is possible. If that is not possible, we need to reserve space for Sabina in all 3 courses and she will enroll as soon as her registration screen is activated. Thank you.

It breaks my heart to read that I wrote &quot;I have, however, a vision, of Ingie and you and me and the dog and the cat, in the Bronx, eating crumpets (or pancakes) and reading the Sunday paper (strewn all over the room). I have a vision of Ingie hobbling downstairs to buy peanut butter or whatever. I have a vision – oh, this is so sad – of Ingie in hospital in New York when she is not well.&quot;

There was no way. I don&#39;t think you appreciate how many things I needed to do to tie things up in Formentera. I slept three hours the two last nights. There was no way I was going to go over a list on the plane. I had pushed myself harder than most people ever push themselves, and achieved correspondingly more than most people would have achieved in those circumstances in such a short space of time. I&#39;m concerned that you don&#39;t appreciate how much I did. And the reason I did all that, rather than take more time for mourning, more time for quiet space in Ingie&#39;s space, was because of the urgency of making my return to New York smooth as soon as possible. When the house is sold I will be able to establish myself comfortably in New York. Putting the house up for sale - and renting it out to pay for some of the paperwork - was no mean feat. It can take months to go through someone&#39;s things. All of Ingie&#39;s things. All the objects she had kept, that she had accrued throughout her life.

the guy in the trunk managed to get the sleeping woman&#39;s husband sent to Italy. While her husband&#39;s away he get&#39;s into the woman&#39;s bedroom by being carried in in a trunk. He sees her nekkid and sees she has a mole on her butt or something like that. When her husband comes home he says he had sex with her and the proof is that she has a mole on her butt.

But I remember the important stuff. Today I watched a few videos of RSC productions of WT on Youtube with members of the cast - yes I remember Maya&#39;s phone number now - and the WT video ended and there was another video, of a woman lying on a bed asleep, a trunk next to her, and a man in the trunk.

As you know I tend to worry incessantly that delay on some items may sacrif=
ice
a handful of future opportunities for you. When it comes to seizing
opportunities, timing matters. If your friends and acquaintances more or
less know what you are looking for then when something pops on their radar
you want to be foremost in their minds. I'm reassured again and again and
again when I behold, in real time, the marvels you have achieved and are
achieving. I'm glad we're finally in beginning to resynch.

Googled "adjunct instructor resume" and "personal assistant resume" and
behold the results, especially the nuanced differences in how they are
structured.

There are a bunch of job search sites

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sherri-thomas/2016-best-
career-apps-and_b_9125474.html


Check CUNY and individual college offerings too. I think you made an
appointment with the CCNY Career Center when you were last here, so follow
up with them as well. I think they are primarily oriented towards post
graduation careers, rather than employment to supplement graduate school,
but they can help with resume tips and perhaps other stuff -- as an CCNY
Alumnae, they work for you.

Though most of the types of jobs you should be seeking, 1-2 years at
part-time or summer are mostly word of mouth:

Add here: Mikhal Dekel (she runs the Rifkind Center and likely has a lot of
connections at other colleges: CUNY, NYU, Columbia) and Linda Carlson (I
mentioned that BlackBoard class she put together because it means that she
does more than administrative stuff, maybe they need really sharp TAs).
They both may have leads on non-adjunct CCNY or CUNY job opportunities, but
they may also be able to help you get over the hurdle that adjuncts need to
have masters degrees. You have a decade of teaching experience, including
college level; lack of experience probably why there is an embargo. With
enough of the right advocates, exceptions *can* be made.

Yanna, Barbara, and Mikhal can help with English. Humanities also has the
Foreign Language and History departments, which Melissa might know
something about, maybe even Elizabeth Strarcevic (who is retired but still
loose touch).  For a time Evi was *the* German Department-- administrator,
primary instructor, adjunct wrangler -- her credentials and undergraduate
degree in art and being a native speaker, so anything is possible.

Also, you might ask Cappetti about opportunities at the Center for Worker
Education, you had some interaction with Juan Carlos Mercado, who is still
the dean there and was the chair for Foreign Languages a decade ago.

Renee Phillippi is probably a good person to add her as well. She's on the
theatre circuit. Often there are exciting summer jobs, the pay
probably sucks but in a pinch. Also, you may find something of soul-worthy
interest that supplements a day job.

I think you should use both the ProFellow, Fulbright networks, and Honor
Society networks. Maybe even look into the Shakespeare Association. You
often seem to poo-poo this idea as a false lead. But those folks make a
living doing the things you want to be doing.

It will probably take at least half a year for you to sell you real estate
and be able to looking into ownership options, transactions which can take
3-12 months to conclude. Taking the UHAB workshop and applying for a few
programs is a good initial step for unlocking those future opportunities.

While you seem very healthy, at your age one never knows. Plus, if you want
to start seeing a therapist, you won't be able to afford it out of pocket.
So insurance should be a factor.

Thank you very, very much for helping me today and for bearing with me as I
> battled with demon gnats.
>


Now, I return to address your demonic gnats. Few things in life delight me
more than helping to illuminate your path as you forge into the wilderness
of realizing the fullness of your potential and dreams. Very few things, as
our correspondence no doubt affirms.

However, another thing that our correspondence no doubt bears out is that
often enough when you are swatting at your demonic gnats the ones most
abused are my feelings, our relationship, and probably your mental health. =
You
often treat my concerns and requests as though they are a nuisance averting
you from attending ... swarming demon gnats. Two and three times a year I
make an appeal to you like the one I fumbled last weekend when I walked to
Central Park. Our meta chat yesterday was a better example. For merely
suggesting that we review this plan of your future (a 10-15 minute
exercise, with maybe another 45 if we decided to talk it through) rather
than doing that, for 30 minutes we tussled about how busy you have been
with every waking moment since April 4th (eight days before) when I
originally suggested it when you were on the verge of many hours. And then
we talked it through, and it was worth the time and effort.

But all of this gets lost when you swat at me as though I some kind of
demonic gnat. It makes me walk on pins and needles, hesitating to suggest
something because I know you'll hit me with a litany of how busy you are
and how much I don't appreciate your busyness (though I often do), that
grave matters are on the brink of catastrophe and only you can save them.

Mindful of your tendency to "catastrophize" (as you've dubbed it), I
persistently urge you to balance things out so that you aren't the linch
pin holding everything you're working on together and to take small,
measured steps to advance your future so that when you get there you don't
have to do everything in one chaotic, stressful, last-minute lurch.

Even before Ingie's funeral and the estate arrangements (which were
understandable larger concerns), you're always juggling dozens of things
you must attend immediately or they will collapse into a vacuum of chaos.
Before your departure it was WT, your ETAs, and Colombian social
activities. In Spain there was always stuff with Capital Languages, and for
a time grad school applications and before that completing your
undergraduate stuff, and before that stuff I can't remember with Nacho,
finding sobriety, working menial jobs. All things I have endeavored to help
you with, as much as I can.  I know how important these other
responsibilities are to you and to the people who rely upon you and and how
intensely you attend them.

If you look at your life's pattern over the last few years there is a
definite, steeply rising curve with your accomplishment growing more and
more rewarding. I am always mindful that ultimately your future is at least
as important as each transient stepping up you're taking. So I constantly
urge balancing your immediate needs with your future ones. (In a quieter
voice I also urge respecting the nurturing needs of our friendship.)
Concerns which you often enough cast aside as too demanding given the
gravity of some impending catastrophe or your need to recuperate from some
heroic intervention. Often enough when you get into your own independent
rhythm you spurn me, which causes me to melodramatically spiral into high
dudgeon-- something I have been working on.

We have had this meta conversation many, many times before. Now that you
are returning to the city, I do not want to continue having these bouts
where you treat me as though I were the demon (an analogy we have used in
the conversation many times before if you care to search for it). I suspect
this pattern is bound up in mental conditions forged in your life's trauma
as well as mine (my obsessive, "co-dependence" on you). That the only way
to stop it is for you to get an effective therapist to help you identify,
acknowledge, and exorcize these demons-- as I am doing for myself. But as
with a lot of advice I give you (or the many things I try to do on your
behalf). This is advice you dismiss, defer or take for granted -- at the
peril of your mental health and perhaps our relationship. I do not believe
the pattern will change because of an epiphany you had in your bereavement.
Minds seldom work this way. Generally speaking it take deliberate, skillful
effort or blunt trauma to change mental habits. Regardless, this years-long
cyclical pattern is very disrespectful to me and to our friendship. Whether
you get a therapist or not, this pattern must stop. Given how much I care
about you and how devoted I have always been to you, it is precarious
enough for me balancing our relationship together with my marriage, without
the extra conflict it will generate when you are no longer separated by a
land mass.

For years and years I have been urging better balance and more mindfulness
in how we treat one another. I do not want our relationship to deteriorate
to nothing. I have been trying to circumvent the paths that lead to this
fate by being patient, tolerant, adaptive, honest, and forthright. Once
again, few things in life delight me more than helping to illuminate your
path as you forge into the wilderness of realizing the fullness of your
potential and dreams. Very few things, as our correspondence no doubt
affirms. I hope that we can get back to long musings on our mutual
interests in literature, art, films, but also interests we have that are
mutually exclusive. But this will require that you stop catastrophizing, so
that nurturing our friendship remains a high priority. If our past is a
good predictor, I would be foolhardy to expect it for much longer than a
week or two, until the next series of catastrophies.

I hope that you are right and that things have changed. If it has it will
be demonstrated in how you and I act not by what you or I proclaim.

Lovefully,

v

conditions my transition and makes it much more difficult. I cannot drag In=

both of us, because she has no savings left. I will need to feed, clothe an=

Dear Vern,

Thank you very, very much for helping me today and for bearing with me as I
battled with demon gnats.

Here is a new list, notes taken during our chat today. I haven't put things
in order of priority as I have to do most of these things at the same time.
I'm sharing this on Drive too.

All my love, and all my gratitude. B

1.    Two resumes

a.    One for becoming an adjunct.

b.    Another for Shakespearean or production stuff? Or for logistical
stuff? Or emphasizing languages?

c.    get an up to date resume and ask for feedback on formatting



2.    Job

a.    Reach out to English Department and History Department (I could
surely do World Civ). If I can get the English Department to make me an
adjunct I might be able to get something this summer if not the fall and
know how much I'll make.

b.    Draft emails to people who could probably get me plum assignments as
adjunct

=C2=B7         Melissa

=C2=B7         Cappetti - also ask Cappetti (who is a leader in the PSC uni=
on)
about the pros and cons

=C2=B7         Barbara

=C2=B7         Yanna

=C2=B7         Josh -- but I have to go easy on my requests to him

=C2=B7         Victoria

=C2=B7         Mark McBeth



3.    Taxes: 2015 and 2016

a.    Tax info from U.S. Embassy

b.    1040 EZ



4.    FAFSA - deadline 30 June 2017 but must get in asap



5.    CUNY CAP Fellowship

a.    When is deadline? Find out.

b.    Write statement

c.    Get letters of recommendation: write to Cappetti and Josh (and
Stein?) (what about people here? The Dean? Fulbright Program Officer? Diana
the Director of the International Relations Office?)

6.    Housing

a.    Budget: we need to know how much I can afford to pay before anyone
can earnestly look

b.    Ask Lance and Irma how long I can stay with them. Will they rent me a
room? That would be perfect.

c.    Affordable housing takes a really long time, but the sooner I apply
the better.

7.    Healh insurance

a.    When looking for a job I should factor in health insurance. CUNY
adjuncts have very good insurance.

b.    Apply for Medicaid, although it is very precarious



8.    Draft out a plan

a.    run it by Josh and Cappetti for feedback -- they can tell me who I
should and shouldn't reach out to. Maybe I could also bring Linda Carlson

b.    Check out Carlson=E2=80=99s blackboard class on Amusing Yourself to D=
eath.

Dear Bini,

I'm returning to this email thread because ... we'll I have been waiting
for you to start planning your transition since, well, this time last
year-- before you decided to extend your Fulbright. I hope that we can get
back to building on this the marvelous network of friends and family you've
been cultivating this many years. As I've urged many times over the years,
please don't try to single-mindedly plan your future based on gut instincts
and immediate circumstance. Work with your clan -- our clan -- to optimize
your pursuit of a good (not just okay) home, career, life.

v

morning. She misses me terribly, and I miss her terribly too. These two yea=

Hey B,

I was online when you sent this yesterday. I figured you must have seen me
when you sent this dispatch but, typically, issued no greeting. Usually
this vexes me, as a sign of the apprehension you feel whenever I attempt to
engage you on these matters. I often speculate why it's so difficult to
break these monumental ideas into architectural plans, then bricks and
mortar, and then buildings and works. We have such a bizarre, efficient way
of *not* communicating.

I logged on upon returning from taking the girls to see the original *Plane=
t
of the Apes*, a fantastic commentary of the relentlessness of human drive
towards and the inevitability of the apocalypse. Charlton Heston gives a
riveting performance as an =C3=BCbermensch-- cynical, self-serving, dominee=
ring,
manipulative, clever -- slingshot into a future-as-past world in which
docile, primitive man is dominated by a hierarchical society of brutish,
pre-industrial apes. It's a blunt but captivating depiction of the will of
a few who dominate others (whether individuals or masses) by exploiting the
cult of personality, science, logic, religion, brute force, hypocrisy, soci=
al
conventions and widespread idiocy to paralyze and control the everyone
else. Released in 1968, the scripting, cinematography, and editing are
fascinating. Its twist ending is one of the most iconic in film history.
The girls and I watched it at home a few years ago; since then I have been
anticipating a theatrical release. I was delighted when it showed up on the
Film Forum Jr. screening schedule. I was very pleased that they remembered
the final shot and are beginning to grasp the eureka of its implications.

Afterwards I went to one of my old haunts, St. Marks Comics, to pick up
some boxes for all my old Nations, New Yorkers and NYRBs. Throughout the
90s I would go there weekly to peruse comics and graphic novels. Organizing
my office I've been revisiting some old stories in my collection of
magazines and graphic novels. It really is an amazing library of ideas.
Recently I've been adding to my graphic novels but there is so much
godawfulness to sort through. I've always liked the idea of Heavy Metal's
sci-fi and fantasy explorations better than the actuality of it. But
whenever I actually read an issue I'm out of synch with the sophomoric
depiction of sex and violence in the stories. The past few weeks I've been
reading up on Moebius, a genius of the medium as both an artist and
storyteller:

https://www.go90.com/profiles/va_astid:54af6ee21e0d4803bfc66e9ead154adc,tid=
:0cf603f3c1d84ec7a2c6251d53f05b61,vid:54af6ee21e0d4803bfc66e9ead154adc

So I purchased *The World of Edena*. It's a fantastic futurist story of two
colleagues who go from friends to lovers enduring my trials through
separation. I see many allegorical parallels to our relationship. I'm
taking my time to savor it.

I found a basket of my personal journals going back as far as 1984,
sparsely documenting my development and arrested development. One of the
first things I relate in the journal from 1999 is that I'd just destroyed
its immediate predecessor -- ripped it in pieces and deposited them in
separate trash receptacles along Riverside Drive -- out of a sense of
self-disgust that I had been using the journal as a ruse for
self-deception. At the time I was documenting some of the turbulence in my
relationship with you-- we had recently broken up and I was
regrettably rebounding with Sondra. A few weeks into the new journal you
were jailed and soon after that you were gone. My entries were very
sporadic, mostly documenting my stark, confused emotions about my romantic
history and prospects. My solipsistic sense of desperation is a bit
mortifying. There isn't much about you per se, mostly your presence
reverberates as an absence. A startling revelation is that I think my love
for you grew stronger as the years passed: absence and idealism.

Josh, depending on how strong he is. Stein, she's probably crazy busy, but
if she's retired maybe less than she otherwise might have been. Also, it
gives you an opportunity to catch up. Though it often troubles me that you
typically reach out when you need something, I do not think it bothers them
at all. It being an occupational convention.

Yeah, you probably only need a 1040EZ. You should probably file 2015 and
2016, you make so little you're probably due a refund.

It's always been a little fuzzy to me who's stuff you've been holding. I
thought you said there were two or three other people's stuff in there too.
Why ask only Nacho? What about some of your other friends, like the
red-head writer ? The old ladies? Why not Maya, even if she's not familiar
with your Alcoy, she has some expertise-- why are you so averse to
answering this one. Over the years you often make Maya seem more like a
frenemy or dubious acquaintance than a dear old friend. Heck, I bet Lance
and Irma likely have some keen advice.

I think renting would be a better option than taking out a mortgage, but
being a long distance landlord is a real burden unless you have a
trustworthy overseerer. Making long-term commitments to mortgage payments
with interest is a good way to lose the house entirely with no benefit.

Why are your instincts always to go to Google and the Internet rather than
friends and acquaintances?

You don't need an EMPLID to look at CUNY job listings-- otherwise non-CUNY
applicants couldn't apply -- though sometimes if you go to the wrong
webpage it will direct you to a page that implies this. Start here:

http://cuny.jobs/

These are mostly full-time career jobs. Most part-time jobs aren't listed,
they are word of mouth. Ineed, the best way to get a good job is word of
mouth referrals from friends and professional acquaintances. I have a
couple of friends that work at the UN. It's very hard to get a foot in the
door, especially if you are one of thousands of applicants. The same goes
for CUNY and LinkedIn, in fact.

In a word: no. For dozens of reasons that should be obvious. Rather than
applying for random things you find on the internet, look for things that
will serve you where you intend to be. There is an abundance of resources
here in the city. The best way to avail yourself of them is through
networking, not internet scouring.

Consider taking the UHAB workshop. They only post the offerings a month in
advance, you could write to them and let them know when you will be here in
June. Typically they give them once a month and begin after 6PM.

Seriously, why this fixation with living in Red Hook? There are affordable
niches all over the city.

It can take years to score an interview; nevertheless, it's good to put
yourself on a list for NYHA, among others, and sort of forget it. Often
people do and are pleasantly surprised years later when they get an offer
that is better than their present living quarters.

Good. But as I've been saying, the social service safety net is not only
fraying it's being clipped. Better to get a good part-time job that
provides decent benefits. Adjuncts get good health benefits, so long as
they maintain their teaching load.

Of course this is all feasible. Orchestrating is a matter of time and
effort requiring diligent, disciplined, adaptive step-by-step planning and
networking personal connections.

I think this isn't a good first step because they are so many unknown
factors involved. The answer could range from $3,000 to $10,000 depending
on how you phase it in -- how far in advance will you purchase, how much
stuff do you want to bring immediately, how much later, where will you
live, how much will your commute cost, furnishing.

I think the best way to start is delay such questions and begin networking
your actual friends, telling them what you're doing, asking them for
advice, insights, referrals, resources and jotting their answers down. Of
course you should apply for some of the things you've listed above: filling
taxes, FAFSA, housing applications.

Don't do this alone: cultivate your friendships and professional
relationships.

I really don=E2=80=99t know how to start writing this list. This plan. Actu=
ally, I
do know how to start: by starting. By writing it to you. Oh god, Vern, I
can hardly believe you are still here. Now I=E2=80=99m not going to get all
sentimental, at least not right away. This is a list, a plan. Not something
sentimental (I am very intrigued about what might be in that 1999 journal
you found). Okay, let me see.



*CCNY Tuition:*

=C2=B7         I need to apply to the CunyCap Fellowship. I will need two
letters of recommendation. Cappetti and who?



*Financial Aid: *

=C2=B7         I believe I=E2=80=99m not eligible for financial aid for gra=
duate
studies, but to apply for Federal Work-Study and in case I want to apply
for a direct student loan I=E2=80=99m filling in my FAFSA, which says so fa=
r that I
may be eligible for aid. It=E2=80=99s freaky when I get to the drug convict=
ion
questions; however, I answered them truthfully and despite my convictions I
continue to be eligible for financial aid. Now I have to file taxes for
2015 in order to complete my FAFSA.



*Funding: *

=C2=B7         I will sell my house on the mainland. This may take years. I=
t
will involve going to the mainland this summer. My house is full of Nacho=
=E2=80=99s
stuff. I need to get in touch with Nacho and ask him to start taking his
stuff out. Maybe he can help me sell my house. Instead of selling, I could
take out a mortgage but I don=E2=80=99t know if that would be a good idea; =
it would

=C2=B7         I need to look for a job. I just googled CUNY job postings a=

lack certification of my French:

*Housing: *

=C2=B7         I need to apply for affordable housing.

=C2=B7         At first, however, I propose to house myself in, for example=
, the
Red Hook district of the Bronx. I propose to find an apartment share =E2=80=
=93 rent
a room. I might do best in a Latino neighborhood because with my Spanish I
am easily accepted as another hermana in the hood. I don=E2=80=99t know if =
the
South Bronx is Latino.

=C2=B7         I will put myself on a New York Housing Authority list,
requesting low cost housing in a project.



*Health insurance:*

=C2=B7         I will apply for Medicaid, and Ingie will apply for Medicare=
.



*Ingie:*

=C2=B7         This is the big issue. I can only move to New York if I take
Ingie with me. If I don=E2=80=99t manage to do this, I must stay in Spain w=
ith her.
I spoke with her this morning. She misses me terribly, and I miss her
terribly too. These two years so far away have been hard for Ingie, and she
needs me with her now. This conditions my transition and makes it much more
difficult. I cannot drag Ingie around ghettoes. She would, I imagine, be
prepared to live with me in the Bronx, but I need to have our own
apartment, and I need to be able to support both of us, because she has no
savings left. I will need to feed, clothe and house two people, and provide
care for the cat and the dog. This is a very tall order. Do you think,
Vern, that I can do this? I am sure I can, but the question is, how long
will it take me?



*Benito and Lennon:*

=C2=B7         I must cover the cost of bringing both to New York.



There. I have surely left many considerations out. It looks difficult to me
right now, the getting there, to where I want so desperately to be. Right
now this seems like the hardest thing I=E2=80=99ve ever set out to do. I ha=
ve,
however, a vision, of Ingie and you and me and the dog and the cat, in the
Bronx, eating crumpets (or pancakes) and reading the Sunday paper (strewn
all over the room). I have a vision of Ingie hobbling downstairs to buy
peanut butter or whatever. I have a vision =E2=80=93 oh, this is so sad =E2=
=80=93 of Ingie
in hospital in New York when she is not well.



I guess at this point I should figure out how much it will cost to get us
both to New York and settled in, and how much we will need per month to
live. I attach a Word doc of the email I pasted here.

This is such an apt poem to send to me, of all people, that it's surprising
to me that you don't remember why you wanted to send it. It really
encapsulates the anxiety I feel: its origins (in the intergenerational mother's
milks of  trauma), its frantic immediacy ("upon the constant edge of
decision.. [we] cannot indulge the dreams of choice .. loving in doorways
coming and going"), and its affects (compulsive worrying about the future
and the past, inward and outward).

I love this, which captures how I often feel as I slog through my days
longing for escape: "at once before and after seeking a now that can breed
futures like bread in our children's mouths so their dreams will not
reflect the death of ours"

"Seeking a now" calls to mind how the way you live your life is a
demonstration of not just seeking but grasping *now* without too much
regard for before and after.

I did not know Audre Lourde was an African-American woman, her name always
struck conjured an old white man, like Ezra Pound.

Thanks

Hey, going through drafts I came across this. I don't remember why I was
going to send you this poem. Don't remember at all. But it is good, and
fitting, and here it is.
*A Litany for Survival *by Audre Lorde

For those of us who live at the shoreline
standing upon the constant edges of decision
crucial and alone
for those of us who cannot indulge
the passing dreams of choice
who love in doorways coming and going
in the hours between dawns
looking inward and outward
at once before and after
seeking a now that can breed
futures
like bread in our children's mouths
so their dreams will not reflect
the death of ours:

For those of us
who were imprinted with fear
like a faint line in the center of our foreheads
learning to be afraid with our mother's milk
for by this weapon
this illusion of some safety to be found
the heavy-footed hoped to silence us
For all of us
this instant and this triumph
We were never meant to survive.

And when the sun rises we are afraid
it might not remain
when the sun sets we are afraid
it might not rise in the morning
when our stomachs are full we are afraid
of indigestion
when our stomachs are empty we are afraid
we may never eat again
when we are loved we are afraid
love will vanish
when we are alone we are afraid
love will never return
and when we speak we are afraid
our words will not be heard
nor welcomed
but when we are silent
we are still afraid

So it is better to speak
remembering
we were never meant to survive

If you can get a couple of folks advocating for you at CCNY/CUNY I think you might be able to get an adjunct job -- maybe even in the summer, as trial. They tend to favor long-standing ones, but you have enough folks that know you and have a strong resume -- if you can get folks to look beyond all the Spanish and Colombia references.

Those emails aren&#39;t worth waiting for. My attending the conference was mostly to check in on her health and put in a good word for you. The paper provided a framework for her remarks but they don&#39;t capture the spirit of some of her spontaneous remarks, which set the tenor.

I gave Maya the name of the best lawyer in Ibiza. Gave her careful instructions of what to do in court if she wasn&#39;t happy with sentence prosecutor asked for. I fear she followed none of my advice. I gave advice to Lance too, and Fred and Achi. I don&#39;t think they retained the lawyer I recommended. I don&#39;t know and don&#39;t really want to ask now, but I doubt they did.

You should add BMCC to your list of community colleges. They are near CWE (a couple of train stops) and could save you a lot of wear and tear since it&#39;s on the same train line as CWE and CCNY.

and even though I have no idea how I know what I know about the academic side of CCNY, my instincts are on target -- though not quite the bull eye, which is why I always urge to to reach out widely. Because when folks get back to you they will corroborate each other than that&#39;s liklely the best path.

yes. thank you. I&#39;m so happy I spoke with Barbara. thank you so much. I feel like such a shit when I get irritated because you&#39;re nudging. It&#39;s ridiculous. I get irritated and then remember that you&#39;re nudging me for my good, with my interests in mind, and that it&#39;s good for me and you probably don&#39;t like my getting all crabby either, so irritation goes away

You should try to finish out your list of emails. You never know who has a hot tip in their pocket and they don&#39;t have to be dissertations. You&#39;ve got a fine template, just burst them out. But you have to follow up relatively quickly with those who express interest--- like the chap Linda referred -- otherwise you may forget or a plum assignment goes to someone else. The UN job sounds interesting -- but I know a few folks who work there, it can be demanding (especially if you&#39;re taking 3 graduate classes),

Oh Vern this poem is so beautiful, it made me sob. Oh, Ingie. Ingie. I miss
her so much. It hurts like an ocean of hurt.

Oh Ingie. Oh Lennon. Oh that sweet happiness inside Maya that's gone.

I love how you say I'm taking a soaring dive. You are helping me
tremendously, being there. You give me great strength. Sometimes I'm
scared, and I know you're there, and I feel safer, knowing I'm loved, and
loving you.

Isn't it strange what happened. Now. I had just got in touch with Juan
Roque, who I have not seen since then, to defend Maya in a case not unlike
mine. It almost feels as if I summoned Jos=C3=A9. But don't worry, I feel s=
afe.
Shaken - it was so bizarre when I saw a message from him! I saw his name -
Jose del Olmo - and for a micro second it didn't look strange, because I
know the name and have it in places in my computer - not many, but there's
a file in documents and another in Drive - so for a split second it didn't
look strange, until it hit me that this was on Facebook Messenger! The
knowledge came in like woosh woosh wooosh. A shudder ran right through me,
and all my senses went on high alert. Scary, freaky. But don't worry, I'm
okay. I was scared to open the letter (it was attached as a Word doc).

I don't want this man intruding on my life. I don't have to do anything
though. I don't have to do anything. I'm safe. I need to call the
psychologist tomorrow. Maybe I should get in touch with Ana.

I'm going to sleep. Today has been another very long day. Hugs and kisses. =
B

You were considering sending me some letter to (or from) a lawyer that
summarizes the state of things. I'm not sure whether you forgot or just had
second thoughts about it. I feel like I'm just outside the cusp of the
family circle on this thing. I'd like to help out however I can, even if
that just means fortifying you.

You should not feel bad. You have been writing. I cherish your last two
emails and, having bridled my insatiable appetite, have a newfound
appreciation for smaller yet equally profound gestures. Plus, it's not just
the trauma that Maya's going through, someone did die: Ingie and Lennon


Mother, A Cradle to Hold Me

It is true
I was created in you.
It is also true
That you were created for me.
I owned your voice.
It was shaped and tuned to soothe me.
Your arms were molded
Into a cradle to hold me, to rock me.
The scent of your body was the air
Perfumed for me to breathe.

Mother,
During those early, dearest days
I did not dream that you had
A large life which included me,
For I had a life
Which was only you.

Time passed steadily and drew us apart.
I was unwilling.
I feared if I let you go
You would leave me eternally.
You smiled at my fears, saying
I could not stay in your lap forever.
That one day you would have to stand
And where would I be?
You smiled again.
I did not.
Without warning you left me,
But you returned immediately.
You left again and returned,
I admit, quickly,
But relief did not rest with me easily.
You left again, but again returned.
You left again, but again returned.
Each time you reentered my world
You brought assurance.
Slowly I gained confidence.

You thought you know me,
But I did know you,
You thought you were watching me,
But I did hold you securely in my sight,
Recording every moment,
Memorizing your smiles, tracing your frowns.
In your absence
I rehearsed you,
The way you had of singing
On a breeze,
While a sob lay
At the root of your song.

The way you posed your head
So that the light could caress your face
When you put your fingers on my hand
And your hand on my arm,
I was blessed with a sense of health,
Of strength and very good fortune.

You were always
the heart of happiness to me,
Bringing nougats of glee,
Sweets of open laughter.

I loved you even during the years
When you knew nothing
And I knew everything, I loved you still.
Condescendingly of course,
>From my high perch
Of teenage wisdom.
I spoke sharply of you, often
Because you were slow to understand.
I grew older and
Was stunned to find
How much knowledge you had gleaned.
And so quickly.

Mother, I have learned enough now
To know I have learned nearly nothing.
On this day
When mothers are being honored,
Let me thank you
That my selfishness, ignorance, and mockery
Did not bring you to
Discard me like a broken doll
Which had lost its favor.
I thank you that
You still find something in me
To cherish, to admire and to love.

I thank you, Mother.
I love you.

- Maya Angelou

> Oh man. Tomorrow I have an intense day again.

We spoke briefly. Cappetti gave me your CUNY Cap letter. I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do with it, so I've tucked it in my Maya Angelou book,
facing the "Mother" poem, so Ingie can read it. Though I'm not quite sure
why she would be afixed, like a stamp, to Cappetti's letter. Transmigration
of the souls, go figure.

I don't often feel religious sentiment but hallelujah it's Friday!

I've gotten so accustomed to you catastrophizing and distorting at this
point in the academic term that I have been anticipating this phase for
months! However, this is probably the worst stretch of rough road you've
endured almost sense of known you. Certainly this is the worst, because at
least before Ingie was always there as a corporeal presence and not a
spiritual apparition. No catastrophizing or distortions needed. Regardless,
 my advise remains pretty much the same. I could probably go back to an
email from this time last year (or the year before) to copy and paste my
usual spiel: rest, relax, pace yourself, suppress your natural inclination
to perfectionize, seek comfort in friends, yadda yadda.

We are born in pain, then relief comes.

We are lost in the dark, then day breaks.

We are confused, confounded, and fearful.

Then faith takes our hand.

We stumble and fumble and fall,

Then, we rise.

- Maya Angelou


You are rising, Bini. This is merely a soaring dive. Find succor in that.

v


big hug. B

in terms of demands on my time. I need to step back, cut back somewhere;
yesterday and today I spent about five or six hours of each helping Maya
and helping Lance help Maya. Right now I feel as if I made no headway
anywhere, with anything, but I think I must have made some progress. I feel
really bad because I haven't written, and then you say there's always
something, but what Maya is going through is not any old thing; it's of a
magnitude like someone close dying. Something did die, somewhere.

Oh man. Tomorrow I have an intense day again.

How are you?

I think I'm singeing. I look forward tremendously to being there. This last
haul requires great effort. Oh, man. Yeeesh. You see, I'm braindead! Can
only make strange bleepy noises and say Oh man. Oh man. I miss you so much.

i mean just that: a contract? are you worried that you are being used? are you worried that i am using you? are you worried that you give more than you get, that you are being short-changed? are we to reduce this to something countable? a favor is not a favor if it is paid for by something in exchange. a gift is not a gift when the giver wants something back and is concerned and worried when the investment has not brought its return

Sabina:  I am writing something about Ingie, for me.<br>I suppose I can write something about Ingie for you<br> me:  I enjoy chatting with you and will love it when you&#39;re here, but this correspondence is a signature of our relationship. It&#39;s very, very important to me. More than you can imagine. I do not want it to disappear just because you will be near.<br>I have to go defuse this bomb.<br> Sabina:  But I will do this when I do it. Okay. I appreciate your wanting to continue our correspondence and I appreciate its importance. I think it&#39;s important too. It&#39;s really a writing of a book.

Do you think you are manipulative, Vern? Do you think your behavior right now, with this renewed demand now, when I have just gained momentum and am just starting to find my way out of a dark and tangled wood, now that I am actually managing to do things well, might be on some subconscious level designed to bring me down? To push me over the edge? No, you are completely wrong. I do not dismiss it at all. I have felt like shit since you wrote about writing yesterday. All my umph is gone. I have been spiraling down into pain and depression again, especially because I, like an idiot, started writing about Ingie to comply with your request.

I can understand why you wouldn&#39;t be ready to write about Ingie -- though I wasn&#39;t asking for a penetrating pscyhoanalystic biography -- but this has been something I&#39;ve been talking about for a really long time. It never seems to get better.

I&#39;ve been thinking a lot -- for several months -- that I need to take a break from you for a while. When Ingie passed I wanted to be there for you and I wanted to give you forward momentum on the return to graduate school. But this correspondence thing has been bothering me for a really long time. And I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s end with it. Anything that is important to you I accommodate. Almost anything I say is important to me you &quot;say&quot; it&#39;s important but you &quot;behave&quot; like it&#39;s a nuisance or toilsome.

Lovely email this. I'm glad you got the Angelou and Brooks.

I spent about five hours of my fourteen-hour day talking with Lance and
corresponding in a storm of emails between Lance, Irma, Catlin, Cassandra,
sometimes Maya (not many of our emails go to Maya; we're writing back and
forth between the four of us) and myself. It's great that Cassandra jumped
in. I hadn't had any contact with her in twenty years. It feels strange to
read her. Deep emotional stirrings.

I'm going to bed now because I can hardly keep my eyes open. I have two
phone conference appointments - three way: Lance, I and first one lawyer
then another - early in the morning, then the phone job interview with
Svetlana. I'd love to talk with you about that but I don't know where the
time will be squeezed in from.

I just went out into the patio to turn the outside light off, and i looked
up at the loaded mango tree and the oon behind. I love the mango tree. The
colors are so soft and fine.

Yo, I'm catatonic. Big hug, many kisses. B

*I've tried some African-American literature like the Briar Rabbit series
and some other folklore, but I really wasn't feeling it. Roots was a very
intense experience for them so I'm trying to build on that. We been
watching Good Times, a 70s situational comedy about a nuclear family
triumphing over the indignities of black poverty in Chicago projects. When
I watched it at their age I lived in the south with the fumes of Jim Crow,
the King and Malcolm X assassinations, Cassius Clay transmuted into
Muhammad Ali, Black Power was ascendant, the Jackson 5 were transcendent,
and we watched black folks grooving on Soul Train every Saturday on TV.*

*Their lives are very racially integrated. Besides the core staples
(Wright, Ellison, Hughes, Baldwin, Morrison, Angelou, Brooks, Achebe), I
never really got much into black literature myself. Somehow it felt too
oppressively intimate, like picking fresh scabs covering trauma wounds. *

*You are right, though! So I've added some Maya Angelou and Gwendolyn
Brooks to my Amazon cart, maybe I'll go to Labyrinth Books for lunch and
pick some up, they should make for excellent bedtime reading. We already
have Langston and I haven't read him to them in years.*

*I'm glad you persisted with it, but in the moment when I can see the toll
all this extra effort takes on you --- often and especially at our expense
-- I'm inclined to give the same advice. I think if you could somehow coax
yourself into keeping your load balanced by not allowing small obligations
snowball and then queue things would go much more smoothly. But I
understand that's much easier said than done.*

>


*The limbo has almost nothing to do with us not being at loggerheads. It
has to do with my being exhausted by being at loggerheads sitting on pins
and needles for a couple of months waiting for you to do these tasks. A lot
of this stuff could have been done in December or January. **You tend to
wait until things need to be done -- usually when a great deal of other
things also need to be done -- and it creates a lot of unnecessary pressure
on yourself and anxiety for me. **I'm glad you're doing it now, but the
waiting creates tension for me because it's relatively important and
relatively simple and the synergy created by doing things early tends to
create greater opportunities. *

*But I also feel a bit in limbo because this is the point in our pattern
when you tend to disappear. You say you're not going to do that this time,
but you tend to say that and then disappear anyway. So it's muscle memory.
PLUS, you are closer to returning permanently than you've ever been. I'm
going to be a little antsy about that until it manifests in reality.*

intrigued.*

*I cannot begin to tell you how sick I am of being naggy. I can assure you
I dread it more than you. You only have to hear it through our
correspondence, I'm continuously doing calculus on these things in my head.
Until you've established a stable foundation, no stone should be left
unturned, even the stones under the stones.*

*Yeah, in the end her offer seemed a bit anti-climactic. The rate is much
too low. But it is an option if others fall through. Oftentimes such
limited opportunities provide gateways to more beneficial ones. Maybe she
would be so impressed by your over-qualifications that she recommends a
better fit.*

*I know that the Fulbright experience has been wondrous for you. But in
looking back on it (respice, aspice, prospice), I wonder what wondrous
experiences you would have had if you had begun here in the city one or two
years ago. I fiercely believe that everything you've done there you could
have done here and more in the same time. But the Fulbright is a shiny star
and it was poetic that you returned to remove the blemish from your
youthful escapade there. Perhaps blemish isn't the right word, but I'm
impressed and pleased that you are systematically returning to your past in
your present and rectifying things. Perhaps rectify isn't the right word
either.*

*When you decided you were returning to Colombia in part because you didn't
feel quite ready for New York City (in part because you wanted to finish
many things you'd started), there were many things that I hoped you would
use this time learn to change within yourself: your tendencies to
procrastinate, to improvise a little less and plan little more, to
appreciate aspice without forsaking respice and prospice, to create an
equilibrium between engaging fellowship and yielding to solitude. These are
ways of living that can make the difference between a life of grace and one
of chaos. Once the stress and strain of living chaotically are over it's so
easy to revert back to stressful, avoidable habits. Good therapy and/or
consistent journaling can reveal patterns we wouldn't otherwise notice and
attend.*

*Oooosh, I need to get something to eat. I wrote that whole paragraph in a
hunger trance, triggered by your procrastinating on these attendance lists.
I hope you got it finished having learned a lesson. I know as an adjunct
there is a strict deadline on these things, it can be a factor in whether
one gets retained or not.*

*There are a whole bunch of niggling issues I'm struggling with that I wish
we could talk about. But we get so sucked into my obsessive habit of
talking about your stuff that there's hardly any room for us to seriously
engage my stuff. Anyway, my stomach sounds like I have a hibernating bear
afflicted with apnea snoring in it. So I'm going to run to Labyrinth and
get some Black poetry and lunch.*

Ha! But I bet they do know how humans reproduce. Tell me, are you sure
Santa Claus is religious? Even if I grant you that (have to think about
it), you think the Easter Bunny is a religious thing? That's quite a
stretch if you ask me.

Oh man Ben Hur. What good children (actually that's not fair; I think I saw
Ben Hur when I was quite young but don't remember it at all). It's great
that Olivia and Lucia are becoming familiar with all this stuff. Make sure
you include African literature in your sallying forth.

I don't know if it's fair to say Jesus killed the gods. The movement from
pantheism to monotheism began with Judaism, from which grew Christianity,
and then Islam came along too. Actually, I understand that Zoroastrianism
is the oldest monotheistic religion.

Note that in Shakespeare, there is never any mention of the Christian
Church or of Christ.

The nudging got me up to a precarious place I can easily topple down from.
So I do not feel anti-climactic. I feel like I am on a mission, to stay up
and be as efficient as I was in Formentera, for example, or as efficient as
I was when I worked to graduate with honors (remember you saying I didn't
need to get an A in Math?).

Rather than be in limbo, let's enjoy. Do you think maybe you feel in limbo
because we are not at loggerheads? One gets so used to bad dynamics. We
have seriously severe codependence. I think it would be great if we went to
therapy together at some point.

Oh Vern, I'm awful aren't I. Sometimes I have thought you were being
unreasonable and naggy when you were asking me to do the most simple
things, like writing to Svetlana. Oh, I am so tired of me. Imagine living
with me all day and night, like I have to.

I so look forward to living in one place for many years. It'll be much
easier to cultivate good friendships when I do that.

Yeah, and how I'm feeling now, again. I'm going home now, I think. I have

At B&H I surveyed the handful of turntables on display with one of their
sales associates. I explained that I wanted a turntable to listen to and
digitize albums of Shakespeare. It turns out he is an audiophile who has
produced music for the Staten Island Theatre Company for productions of
Shakespeare, small world, Shakespeare is everywhere!:

http://www.sistny.org/


He said they do Shakespeare almost every year but that the real draw to
Staten Island is the annual Lumen Festival.

https://statenislandarts.org/lumen-2/


I did not, however, buy a turntable. Reading the Amazon reviews of those in
their selection some of the best feedback recommended investing in a 1970s
hi-fi turntable and a digital adapter rather than these contemporaneous
models. So I'm kinda torn between doing that and getting a cheap portable
unit (the regular ones take up a lot of space and I'm not convinced I want
to become an audiophile). There is a prospering vinyl scene in the city
now, so I'm thinking this weekend I'll hopscotch around town conferring
with vinyl heads to see what's what. Maybe I'll even ask Max, Irma's son,
since he's a thriving DJ.

I purchased *Jesus of Nazareth* from Barnes and Noble and watched the first
hour with the girls last night. First challenge: explaining the immaculate
conception to heathen kids too young to understand sex and virginity and
whose only religious indoctrination has been child-friendly Greek and Roman
mythology, Santa Claus, and the Easter Bunny. Well, in recent weeks they've
seen Charlton Heston in the *Ten Commandments* (as Moses), and *Ben Hur.* This
weekend's screening of *Jesus Christ Superstar* just left them flummoxed.
I'm hoping *Jesus of Nazareth* will help me put all the pieces into clearer
perspective. After *Nazareth* we'll watch *Spartacus*. Then maybe around
Easter or Christmas we'll start the series all over again. Probably working
through them in chronological order. I keep telling them that Jesus killed
the Roman gods who were transfigurations of Greek gods. This should set
them up nicely for tying in Shakespeare's historical-mythological hybrids.

I'd forgotten that *Jesus of Nazareth *was directed by Franco Zeffirelli
who also directed my favorite big screen adaptations of *Taming of the
Shrew* and *Romeo and Juliet*. Indeed, Olivia Hussey who played Juliet is
also his Virgin Mary. In some behind the scenes videos she seems like quite
the chain-smoking, vixen so it's impressive to see her carry off these
iconic roles in which she transcends her chastity. Here she is at 15
(smoking and drinking and conducting herself like an old lady):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDv-iV1gFgo


After walking from B&H to the Union Square's B&N, I went to the Strand to
check out some photography books and maybe buy Rachel Carlson's *Silent
Spring.* I've been curious about this book for 20 years. My interest was
piqued this weekend after watching a fascinating biography on her. She
conceived *Silent Spring, *a cautionary masterpiece heralding the risk of
environmental disaster (nuclear fallout and industrial pesticides), as her
body and mind were being ravaged by cancer. It's earned a reputation as an
inspiring apex of lyricism and gravity, depicting utopia on the precipice
of catastrophe.

In the end I decided I prefer to buy it from Westsider Books, where they
have a shelf of copies I've had my eye on for a couple of years. But
yesterday after so much walking I didn't feel like getting off the subway
to walk from Westider Records (for more Shakespeare) to Westsider Books
(for the Carlson). Besides, I figure I should finish a few of the books I'm
halfway through (Studs Terkel's *Working* and Janet Malcolm and Vicki
Goldbergs refreshing essays on photography, which I read every 3-4
years) before I leap into that. I should also wait until I have a turntable
and have listened to a few before I start buying more Shakespeare albums.

This all sounds very wonderful. I am glad you've got it rolling. I'm
impressed with their speed in getting back to you and surprised that you
haven't heard back yet from Judith and Josh and that Cappetti is so slow.
Feedback patterns are very hard to predict which is why I urge starting
early with a large list.

I feel a bit in limbo right now with us. All this nudging boulders up
embankments of resistance takes an emotional toll, like when, fueled by
adrenaline to reach a spiritual nirvana exercising (or dancing), one
over-exerts
oneself and feels the aches and pains for days afterward.

I get so exacerbated by the effort it takes you to get critical mass --
urging you to create the list and then follow-through on it in a timely
manner -- that I exhaust myself trying to exercise patient apprehension as
you resist the most benign gestures and requests. You often counter by
concerns about planning the future with the notion that things will just
work out by falling together whenever you get there. But as you assemble
these pieces from ephemeral ideas into a concrete plan I hope you're
beginning appreciate that many of these pieces wouldn't be in play at all
if you hadn't conjured them with care and planning. Every year we have this
back and forth and it never seems to dawn on you that the reason you have
so many (or few) options has to do with your direct actions in cultivating
them (or not). Every year you as I urge you to get started you exhaust me
with your resistance. It takes a cumulative toll.

I feel so very close to going back. It's amazing. And it's an act of faith.

I woke up this morning as I went to sleep last night, thinking of nothing
but whether I am - have been - insensitive to your needs, whether I have
been selfish, whether I am a mean selfish person, whether you have given me
so much more than I have given you, whether it's a bad thing to weigh and
reckon and keep track of favors done and favors owed, and I am still
unsure, still not happy with saying *mea culpa*, I am a horrible person.
What bothers me most is how past patterns - and past grievances - come and
upset the present and put stops on the future of you and I. It seems to me
that we have reached a stalemate, for we cannot seem to move forward until
this is resolved, and how can we resolve it? If I have been at fault in the
past, what can be done about that? Surely not recriminate. Surely not
prostrate myself and say I am sorry, I am selfish and bad. The thing is, I
am not sure that I am; in fact, I think I am generous and good. Of course I
am terribly self-absorbed, or have been, I know that. And I have had very
difficult times with my mind, when I could not face many things. And I
suffer from The Distortion. I explained this; I explained why I didn't make
time for you. Because time for you was my time, time for me, and I didn't
give myself any of that. I know, it's not fair on you, and it's not fair on
me. But that is the past. Now I am troubled, concerned, confused. You say
on one hand that you need to take a break, and then the next day you say we
are still a team, and we will continue to do my transition together. I am
torn between not wanting to accept any help from you, because I understand
it bothers you to give, because you fear feeling used, and accepting your
help and doing this together. I need to think about how decisions I make
now will affect the future, yours and mine. I need to know if you will be
there. I imagine you need to know if I will be there for you. Pledges
should not be made lightly, but sometimes it is necessary to pledge.

I am off to work. I have a monstrously busy day today, and need to catch up
on lots of things I didn't get done this weekend because I was fretting and
also because I have flu. I love you. B

<div dir=3D"ltr"><font size=3D"4" face=3D"garamond, serif">I woke up this m=
orning as I went to sleep last night, thinking of nothing but whether I am =
- have been - insensitive to your needs, whether I have been selfish, wheth=
er I am a mean selfish person, whether you have given me so much more than =
I have given you, whether it&#39;s a bad thing to weigh and reckon and keep=
 track of favors done and favors owed, and I am still unsure, still not hap=
py with saying <i>mea culpa</i>, I am a horrible person. What bothers me mo=
st is how past patterns - and past grievances - come and upset the present =
and put stops on the future of you and I. It seems to me that we have reach=
ed a stalemate, for we cannot seem to move forward until this is resolved, =
and how can we resolve it? If I have been at fault in the past, what can be=
 done about that? Surely not recriminate. Surely not prostrate myself and s=
ay I am sorry, I am selfish and bad. The thing is, I am not sure that I am;=
 in fact, I think I am generous and good. Of course I am terribly self-abso=
rbed, or have been, I know that. And I have had very difficult times with m=
y mind, when I could not face many things. And I suffer from The Distortion=
. I explained this; I explained why I didn&#39;t make time for you. Because=
 time for you was my time, time for me, and I didn&#39;t give myself any of=
 that. I know, it&#39;s not fair on you, and it&#39;s not fair on me. But t=
hat is the past. Now I am troubled, concerned, confused. You say on one han=
d that you need to take a break, and then the next day you say we are still=
 a team, and we will continue to do my transition together. I am torn betwe=
en not wanting to accept any help from you, because I understand it bothers=
 you to give, because you fear feeling used, and accepting your help and do=
ing this together. I need to think about how decisions I make now will affe=
ct the future, yours and mine. I need to know if you will be there. I imagi=

 Hello. I hope you had a good day. I have a bad cold - I hope not flu - and
a fever. It was hard to figure out if I have a fever or if I'm sweating
because of the heat. It has gotten very hot here, suddenly. Rain doesn't
cool the heat: it only makes it worse.

It may be the flu; I hope it's the flu that makes me feel so drained. Short
answers inline below.

 I suppose I was used to people who vowed they=E2=80=99d always be there en=
ding up
not being there after all. Pat, who left Ingie for Anne-Marie and let me go
to Paris when I was eleven, stopped being there for Jason and I. Robert,
who I thought I=E2=80=99d spend my entire life with, abandoned me in a cond=
emned
loft in Paris, with court eviction order tape across the doors =E2=80=93 I =
had to
lift the tape to get in and out of my home. Robert had moved to his
official girlfriend=E2=80=99s apartment in the 18th arrondissement, and wou=
ld soon
afterwards flee to Venezuela to escape debt. Years later Chino, in New
York, who was going to take me to Nicaragua to get me better and then live
with me ever after, was stabbed to death near the George Washington Bridge.
I felt good with you. I wonder if I still have that poem somewhere, the one
I wrote about the fragrant potted bulb you brought me in the Bronx, how it
smelled, and how my body smelled of you. I wrote that the day after the
first night we spent together. I was =E2=80=93 still am =E2=80=93 hopelessl=
y, insatiably
drawn to you.

But you know, even then, I thought on some deep level that you were too
good for me, that I was too fucked, too scarred, too troubled to be your
companion in life. I was married to the drugs, trapped with controlling
demons in my mind. Yes, it took me a long time to get well.


Remember the blasted heath summer? Oh I remember so well how I walked
Lennon at night, how I marched him up the mountain and down, with you, you,
you in my head. And then, when we started talking about my completing my
BA, and going back to New York for the first time in all those years, and I
started to imagine living in New York again, and again, I felt like there
was no way I could aspire to being your companion, because you had flown
high and grown and been successful while I had done nothing with my time.

You know, I don=E2=80=99t think I can accept anything from you anymore. It=
=E2=80=99s
humiliating to be told I reap benefits and give nothing in return. What=E2=
=80=99s
more, I disagree. And I will not stoop to catalog what I give you. If you
think I give you nothing, and therefore do not value what I give, we have a
problem. But I don=E2=80=99t want to be writing about this now. I need some=
 quiet
time to think things through.

Please articulate, though. I am perhaps a happy person because I am
thankful for all the good things I get, and rarely concerned about where my
friends may be falling short. But I don=E2=80=99t want to squabble. I have =

lost my greatest confidante, Ingie, the one person, besides my therapist,
who I could talk with about my relationship with you. Maya doesn=E2=80=99t =

Bini, when you and Ingie left the states 18 years ago the situation felt
similar to me.

In the short time we were together I came to you love you as much as I'd
loved anyone, including Jennifer, who was the first, great love of my life.
As I said in a previous message, as a result of her devotional bond to you,
Ingie felt like a surrogate mother to me.

When we were together it was because I was dazzled by the magnetic
effects of your inner warmth and intellectual brilliance. But it was
obvious to me that you were suffering from what I'd describe as
PTSD-induced addiction, forged within a bewildering youth of neglect,
freedom, abuse, fervor, exploitation, and self-reliance. When we were
together I naively vowed that I would always be here for you. We were
really only together long enough for me to be momentarily infatuated, but
that feeling, having stood the test of (almost) decades, I'm certain it is
pure love. You were in terrible condition for decades -- years before I met
you -- and it has taken years of great effort for you to become this
radiant being I've always known you are.

Driven by the love you, Lance, Irma, Caitlan will shower upon her and her
devotion to Sergio, Maya will almost certainly recover. Nothing is ever
certain in life, but she has an abundance of support and opportunity if she
chooses to embrace it.

I have tried innumerable times to explain this dynamic, it has a recurring
predictable behaviours like the moon orbiting the earth orbiting the sun --
which govern the tides and the seasons.

We have developed this tendency to focus so much effort and attention on
you and your goals, interests, projects, and passions that my interests and
desires become diminutive, negligible. We center our relationship on your
concerns as if they have the gravitation pull and radiance of the sun,
while mine are treated like lunar derivatives. For years I have complained
about this and yet tolerated only gestures to balance the dynamic because I
felt myself to be a quixotic knight to your distressed damsel. But I'm
tired of being quixotic and you're no longer a damsel.

You've my report of what my therapist said out of context and distorted it.
When I raised the question about whether I was using my high dudgeon
withdrawals as a manipulative ruse to get your attention she pointed out
the many benign and life-altering things I've done on your behalf and
suggested that by protesting and refusing, deflecting, diminishing my
simple requests for improved email correspondence -- even as you continue
to reap the benefits of my generous giving -- that I may be the one being
manipulated. It wasn't an assertion but a suggestion. Over the past year
she has been shining a light on my tendency to passionately assume
responsibility for a great many causes and then stress about them as if I
have some moral obligation to do so, when most others in similar
circumstances would not and, in fact, do not.

I do not care whether your other friends can go months or years without an
email. I cannot speak for these other friends of yours, but I don't even
like fathoming being out of contact with you for six days. Six months is
torture. I have a lot of dear friends from back home and here in the city
that I can go years without contact and the endearing love remains fresh,
affectionate, and familiar. My bond with you is special. It's not just
endearing it's ardent. Our correspondence has become a vital part of me.

Friendship implies reciprocity (not necessarily symmetry) of effort. If I
detect some need in you, whether you attempt to articulate it or not, I
will attempt to meet it. My needs and requests are really quite simple:
emails (like this one) at regular intervals. I've often said they don't
have to be polished or potent dissertations, just affective and regular.

I do not doubt you, Sabina, but I do doubt your sensitivity to my needs
(which are simple and singular): regular, uncoerced email correspondence. I
doubt it because you often treat it with great ambivalence. After so many
years, so many tribulations and triumphs, I don't understand ... why?

Thank you for this. Sometimes I crack my hard-boiled eggs the same way, it
just occured to me where I picked that up. I love that old lady.

I am troubled and hurt. I was feeling good about managing to take action to
make my transition happen (I=E2=80=99m very grateful for all the help you g=
ave me
getting started). Now, I feel confused =E2=80=93 I did not think you were u=
nhappy
and breaking inside. Now I am deeply troubled by this knowledge, and
wounded by your need to take a break. Ingie =E2=80=93 Lennon =E2=80=93 Maya=
 =E2=80=93 and now Vern?
Now I lose Vern? Because I lost a part of Maya, you know; the violence that
was done her robbed me of the loving, caring sister she had become. Now she
is scared, changed, and somehow numbed, surely suffering from PTSD.


The first three events =E2=80=93 Ingie =E2=80=93 Lennon =E2=80=93 Maya - ar=
e of the highest
magnitude, and losing you =E2=80=93 you assure me I am not, but I feel lost=
 right
now, and know not what to think =E2=80=93 is on a par.


I don=E2=80=99t understand why this happened. I don=E2=80=99t understand th=
e dynamic. I
don=E2=80=99t understand why now, at the height of my busyness, full of ple=
asure at
getting things done, buoyed up by our newly kindled closeness, warmed deep
inside by the sprinkled words of love you wrote me here and there over the
last weeks (I treasure these), full of visions and dreams and a new
sensuous sensitivity in my limbs, knowing as I do that there will soon be
only meters =E2=80=93 or feet =E2=80=93 of charged air between us. I was al=
most happy. I
was full of purpose and believing again in a certain magic, and then,
starting yesterday, my hopes seem dashed.


We must not do what we did today. We have to find another way. I felt very
close to you, and now I feel distanced again. You say you need a break. I
did not need a break from you =E2=80=93 a break was the last thing I wanted=
, but
now I *do* need, not exactly a break, but quiet time to think things
through. By the way, I think you should consider changing therapists. What
have I done for you, she asked? Pray tell me why, if I have done nothing,
do you love me so? And not just you =E2=80=93 why, when I went to Formenter=
a, did I
feel so greatly loved by my dear friends? I certainly don=E2=80=99t write e=
mails to
*them*; six months can pass without a sign from me. I must give them
something, though, because they proved such love for me. I do not consider
myself a bad friend to you, Vern. There is something very wrong in that
evaluation. Get your therapist a copy of Antony and Cleopatra.


I am sensitive to your needs. There is nothing I want so much as to see you
secure and content in the great love I have for you. I wish you would stop
doubting me. Do you want us to lose each other? Darling, look at what we
have, not what we have not.


Now I will paste below a bit of what I wrote last night, for you, about
Ingie. And back to my transition and my great amount of backed up work,
with a saddened heart and sobered mind.


When I crack a boiled egg I remember how she used to crack hers, and how it
used to irritate me. She would press it round and round upon the table,
splitting the shell into a thousand tiny pieces that then were tricky to
take off. I used to bite my tongue and count to ten, knowing that if I said
anything I would hurt her, and she would feel put down, and it would spoil
her dinner. And yet, she knew. She knew me so well, she could sense my
disapproval without even seeing my eyes. I tried hard to withhold
judgement; for who was I to say how an egg should be cracked? All the same,
she knew how much it bothered me that she was such a slob.

                I wonder when she became a slob. It must have been before I
was born, but not too long before. I think it must have been Pat=E2=80=99s =
fault;
he simply didn=E2=80=99t care if things were neat or not, if they smelled w=
ell or
if they pleased the eye. Ingie, on the other hand, was an artist (although
she would never have called herself one). She had a daring keen aesthetic
sense, and this was always something that was hers; she never doubted her
taste or inclined to what others extolled. She knew, as if instinctively,
what constituted good art. It was not so much instinct, however, as a
thorough understanding of plasticity, rich with multifarious reference
points. She had gone to Cooper Union. What she had learned there was hers,
and no-one could take it away.

                So when she ceased to care that the house was a mess, that
the teapot handle was sticky and the pot lids never washed, it seemed to me
that she had somehow given up. You see, she used to read *Marie Claire
Maison*, and make beautiful bits of furniture and elegant rag rugs. She had
a whole collection of those magazines =E2=80=93 stacks of them =E2=80=93 wh=
ich we threw
away together last summer. She hadn=E2=80=99t looked at them in years. Her =
sloth
was perhaps a defensive reaction, for Pat had caused her to believe that
she could do nothing good. Show her something in bad taste, however, and
she could not conciliate politeness with her views. She didn=E2=80=99t care=
 if she
lived in a pigsty, but a pink frilly curtain was an offense to her eyes.

Okay.

You should call or text me on my mobile (646) 302-1176. Actually texting is
better, sometimes my ringer is off.

I&#39;m talking with Lance in ten minutes. I am the family translator and pushing hard for my great Madrid lawyer taking the case. Juan Roque, who defended me when my ex-husband bit my ear off, is on one of the highest courts in Spain and is a criminal lawyer and is willing to take the case. He says that the sentence is way too light and is surprised at its levity. Dammit, I gave her a good lawyer&#39;s number! And they had a legal aid lawyer defend her. Grrrr. Case can&#39;t be appealed. Grrrr.

I think you&#39;ve got all the pieces together. Start sending out the emails with the resume without too much hand wringing, then leave plenty of space for leisurely responses and diligent following up on leads. You should mention to a few folks that you are also looking for decent temporary housing for the first few months.

You said there was going to be a hearing and also a trial, this seemed to soon to have an actual trial. And given the damage to Maya and both properties it&#39;s insane that he&#39;s been released. This brand of justice will get a woman killed. I reiterate: she&#39;d be better off moving back to NYC for a while and then going to Cali.

my idea was to call Jason on Sundays, instead of calling Ingie, but right now I think calling Boris is good for me. Boris is the brother Jason is not able to be. I will call Jason too. The Ingie call is for both of them, for Jason and Boris.

Vern darling, I&#39;m going to have to make a few phone calls now. I have to call Boris (today is Sunday, remember? I always called Ingie on Sundays) and Jason, who wrote to tell me that his private methadone clinic, the one that gives him injectable methadone amps, is closing. He also said that he is suicidal. He said he craves death.

He lived at Maya&#39;s rent free for five years - she paid all the bills. She bought all of the materials to build the new room. He put labor into it, yes, a lot of labor, but I think that if we calculate what rent would have been and how much money his work represents, Mario probably got the better deal.

yes. Not a tenant. The woman who bought the house out from under Ingie. The house I was born in. It was monstrous that Pat sell it. Ingie had to go live in a goat corral. But that&#39;s all old painful history now. No, Birgit bought the family house. The house has 4000 metres of land. The 2000 metres in front of the house were in Pat&#39;s name. The 2000 metres behind the house were in Ingie&#39;s name.

I found a deed of the whole back garden of C&#39;an Lluqui, from 1963 when she bought it. 2000 square metres. She donated this to me in 1996. I understand that this land was sold to the German woman who bought my father&#39;s house, but there is a slight possibility that it wasn&#39;t.

Of course. But one thing does not rule out the other. We are such complex beings; alongside The Distortion, which is destructive, I have good self-preservation instincts. This afternoon I knew it was not a good idea that I discuss my mental health. It is hard for me now to find balance, and when I am at last not fighting the demons for awhile I don&#39;t want to summon them. I think you must understand.

No, it&#39;s not that. I exercised my right to decline to talk about my mental health this afternoon. This shouldn&#39;t upset you; it&#39;s perfectly normal to not want to talk about that. Vern, you pushed me to engage with my list and get started on all the things I have to do. I&#39;m very grateful to you for that. And I&#39;m very grateful that you are pushing me to seek therapy and address my mental health. However, you must reasonably accept that I can decline to talk about my mental health at a given time if I find it is not a good time for me to talk about it.

I was trying to fill in a tax form, yes, but I wasn&#39;t stressed about it. It was not because I was filling out a tax form that I didn&#39;t want to talk about what I am doing about The Distortion. I was actually really surprised when you started talking about it.

I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to talk about it right now and neither do I. So I&#39;m leaving, but this is something worth contemplating about. Talking about Ana and filing 1040s is the least of what you will be undertaking.

You know I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a very encouraging sign when we&#39;re talking about the importance of Ana (therapy)&#39;s role in helping you achieve your aims and repair our friendship and you need to stop because you are stressed out by doing that and filling out a 1040 simultaneously. What&#39;s going to happen when you are back at work next week for the next six weeks and there are even more demands from your list as well as Fulbright duties.

   YOU ARE LADY MACBETH<br>“Screw your courage to the sticking-place and we&#39;ll not fail.”<br>You are a strong, powerful, charismatic personality. People do what you say...or get the heck out of your way. You are practical, matter of fact, and you&#39;ll do whatever it takes to get the job done. Your single-mindedness can make you a bit of a loner. Three course meals and fancy cocktails aren&#39;t for you - you&#39;re far too practical for that frou frou nonsense. Be careful that, in your drive for excellence, you don&#39;t push everyone away. You might need friends when you least expect it.

“I will never love that which my friend hates”<br>Your friends and family know they can count on you, even when the going gets tough. You are fiercely loyal. You notice and remember specifics about people who are important to you, and are deeply concerned with how others feel. You thrive around other people, and feel a little uncomfortable on your own. You&#39;re always at the ready with a warm hug to console, a witty quip to defuse the tension, or even a slap across the face to admonish the person who wronged your friend.

Just make sure you know when the tuition bill is due -- if you don&#39;t pay it by then you can get deregistered. if you don&#39;t have the cash, they have payment plans -- though I don&#39;t think they are due until nearly the first week of class.

I have a tendency to always be contrarian even when I'm being agreeable, so
my first instinct when you said you'll never have enough time with Ingie's
things was to think, of course you will. You have the rest of your natural
life, which is to say through eternity, to savor her remaining earthly
possessions and ephemeral traces. Being an inveterate and unapologetic
whiner myself, so long as you don't souse yourself in it to they point
where you become dysfunctional, I say whine and pity yourself to your
heart's content.

So does this mean she has two attorneys -- you say she got rid of two of
three and then hired yours? Permission from Mario for what? Given the
violence, the negligible sentence, and the fact that a prepubescent child
is involved, one would expect that the court would at least have stipulated
a requirement for Mario to get therapy. But I think it's better that he's
agreed to go of his own accord. Therapy doesn't begin well if the patient
believes themselves to be under legal coercion. I hope Maya and Sergio are
getting some good treatment too. Where the mind's subconscious workings are
concerned, friendship and familial love have their limits.

Wise decision. With you leaving in slightly less than three weeks, I think
the production would suffer. It sounds like you're a gracious, generous,
and devotional producer and maybe he's a sombitch of a director-- but he's
also a native (right?) and experienced-- so it sends conflicting signals to
the talent when the two "artistic leaders" are in obvious and prolonged
conflict, especially when everyone knows you're leaving at month's end.
Having been provided with scaffolding by you for over a year, it's time for
the cast and crew leaders to stand firmly for their own interests.
Otherwise when you leave their atrophied muscles will collapse under
pressure. Pick your battles carefully and use the purse strings as a bridle
of last resort.

Here a two masterpieces in the adjacent sub-genre of non-idyllic video
documentaries of movie productions that are based on two of my favorite
literary pieces.

Terry Gilliam's Don Quixote
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DqMUGYayk_VQ

Jodorowsky's Dune
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Djg4OCeSTL08


These were epically doomed productions of epics (hopefully yours will skip
the doom part).

So you've covered the Maya intervention, WT, and ETAs, I shudder to ask:
what's happening on the transition front? Receive any more responses?

For my part, I'm very tired. I've been more restless than usual the past
two nights. I spend a lot of this idling time feeling a bit lost in a
wasteland of ... satisfaction. The sleep deprivation combined with the
troubling undercurrent free associations are creating a self-perpetuating
feedback loop.  I have everything I've ever longed for, why am I not happy?
That's a rhetorical question. My therapist and I are doing deeper
excavations into it. The past few months Evi and I have been keeping a
joint journal. We had been skimming the surface but it's beginning to probe
deeper into these awful spirals we fall into. Of course your return at
month's end looms like an enormous, gravity defying event horizon. I
suppose the convergence of these three intersecting streams is quietly
unsettling.

Anyway, I'm tired and a little hungry, time to seek a cure.

I wrote this last night:


As I cut ginger tonight to make a hot drink I thought of Ingie. I think of
her every time I cut ginger, like I think of her when I buy eggplants, and
when I do a million other things. I thought tonight of how much she liked
ginger. Crystallized ginger, ginger snaps, ginger tea. These moments when I
think of nothing but her are mine; sacred, personal, intimate, absorbed. I
want to share them with you, because I know you loved her too.


I long for when I will have my own apartment and time to look through the
notebooks she left for me, full of hand written recipes. I was so happy to
find them. When I was in Formentera, I did not have enough time with her
things. I will never have enough time with them. The moments I long for -
and enjoy, like the ginger cutting moment - are slow languorous moments;
they hurt and in a strange way the pain relieves the greater pain of her
not being here. Because she is present when I surrender to those moments
and commune with memories of her.


I didn=E2=80=99t send the above because it was full of histrionic ohs and a=
hs. When
I=E2=80=99m tired I have a tendency to feel sorry for myself and whine. Now=
 today I
slept enough and things with Maya are getting under control =E2=80=93 she h=
ired my
lawyer Juan Roque to my great relief =E2=80=93 and will be easier to carry =
now that
we =E2=80=93 Lance, Catlin, Cassandra Irma and I =E2=80=93 did a thorough a=
nd intense
evaluation of the situation and a lot of research and reorganizing human
resources from afar (got rid of two of three lawyers and hired one) (got,
at last, permission from Mario and a therapy appointment for him) and all
of our concern and love has helped Maya feel safer (not physically but
emotionally) and less anxious.


I had a sort of epiphany about WT today too. I have been at loggerheads
with the bloody director, have been trying by any means possible to guide
the play in the direction I want it to go aesthetically and politically and
dramaturgically. Well, today I decided that I=E2=80=99m not going to fight =
that
battle any more. The bloody director can fight with the cast and with
whoever he likes, and I will simply hold the purse strings and maybe apply
a little pressure that way. I decided that Ilian and I will oversee the
video documentary and the recording of the whole process to tell the story
of how this project is lurching along. It won=E2=80=99t be an idyllic promo=
tional
video documentary. Quite the opposite. One thing is clear: right now we
have to do a lot of letting go.


So things feel like they=E2=80=99re lightening up. The Maya crisis was very=
 intense
=E2=80=93 I think we all must have spent at least 20 hours each on Maya las=
t week,
if not more. It still is intense, of course, but as I say, more under
control. I have Fulbright reports and teaching things backed up, but they
will be got to.


I=E2=80=99m at work. Ilian is about to get here and I need to sit down and =
talk
with him before going to view Monica=E2=80=99s dance class. I have you on c=
hat. So
I will send this email to you now. Hey, I=E2=80=99m going to be there so so=
on!

Yes, that&#39;s true. The requirement to stay in state imposes bad limitations on professional development. I got medicaid because I was low income. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to pay for private insurance even if my income had been a little higher.

we can have a grrrr session when I get to New York. Look at each other and grrrr until we laugh. Yes, you are right about the series of catastrophes. And I did. And to boot, Lennon died. But I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m handling it. Of course you don&#39;t know, darling. That&#39;s why I am convinced things will be much, much easier when we see each other most days in person. Eyes speak, and bodies speak, and we&#39;re very closely connected and know each other well. But yes, the mountain. I know. I&#39;m daring to look up at it today. Thank you for guiding me and giving me support as I prepare to climb.

You know, there are a few things happening. I do procrastinate and avoid and ostrich, for wrong reasons: the distortion. But sometimes I don&#39;t do things (like look at the list) because I know that if I push myself too hard at a specific moment, when I&#39;ve been under severe mental stress, I&#39;ll snap. So it might be a bit hard to know when I&#39;m distorting and when I&#39;m acting healthily. The plane was a time when I was not distorting.

Since I've known you you've always been pretty good at switching off and
tuning out distractions from the things you are attending. It is a coping
mechanism that seems more a survival instinct than a strategy.

I've grown accustomed to existing like a ghostly apparition in your life,
one of those constantly intervening cinematic guardian angels, a
disembodied, conscientious voice, mostly invisible and intangible, except
in moments of great intensity that can be switched off in moments of
distress or annoyance. I've literally only manifested physically during the
summers of the last three of 18 years (except that first year when I
searched for you in Formentera and then daunted by your mysterious absence
wandered Alicante and La Mancha).

Over the years I've envisioned hundreds of nuanced possibilities on a
continuum -- from our expiring before your return, to our growing
endearingly old together, to our breaking down in a huff of incommunicado
over mutually persistent vexations, to our interweaving a delicate
equilibrium bringing our families and aspirations together -- with thousand=
s
of variations in between. It feels like bad poetry that Ingie and Lennon
might have been within a season of joining you. (Though it seemed like the
fates were more inclined to push you there towards them rather than pulling
them here with you.)

The bounty of possibilities you've been tirelessly harvesting the last few
years have lead you to this great, reaping convergence-- teaching English,
mentoring youth, enlivening Shakespeare, pursuing scholarship, dancing in
celebration of phoenix-like (Phoenician) rebirth. Given the life you've
built for yourself in your triumphant return to Colombia with almost no
connections and few resources, I believe you've only begun to grasp the
enormity of your potential, especially in rich, fertile ground like New
York City.

And yet now that you're within a lunar cycle of your triumphant return to
this great city, to continue the dream lifestyle you set in motion more
than two decades ago, I feel very apprehensive. After so many
transformations (I stopped counting your cocoons years ago) we are about to
become something entirely different. No longer separated by a vast features
of geography, I hope I'll no longer be your Virgilian apparition -- guiding
you through Hell and Purgatory -- and you'll no longer be my Beatricean
heavenly ideal.

That intense feeling is an affect of love and a sign of life, surrender
yourself to it as you would to summer ocean waves.

When Professor Cappetti has written the letter of recommendation can you get it from her? I know you&#39;re really busy but if you can do this I would be really grateful. Professor Cappetti is leaving for Italy on Sunday. Can I write to her and tell her that you will get the letter from her? I don&#39;t know if she is on campus this week; you may have to go to her house.
